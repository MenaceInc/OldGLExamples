# Old OpenGL Examples
A collection of old OpenGL examples brought together using cmake.  
Originally hosted at https://www.opengl.org/archives/resources/code/samples/glut_examples/examples/examples.html

All of these examples are written in C in the early to mid 1990's so the targets for each example is set to ANSI C standard.
